    "# Graded Lab : Tool Use and Reflective Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools‚Äîsuch as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you‚Äôll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML‚Äîlaying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."

    "\n",
    "### 1. Setting Up the Chat with the Language Model\n",
    "- **Tool Selection**: Ensure that the tools are automatically selected by the model. Look into how to set `tool_choice` to \"auto\" within the function call. A helpful resource can be found in [OpenAI‚Äôs Function Calling Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#tool-choice).\n",
    "- **Parameter Configuration**: Consider the parameters already defined in your function, such as model, messages, and tools. Think about how these might be used in your setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Recording Tool Call Results\n",
    "- **Understanding the `ChatCompletionMessage`** object will help you access the required attributes to save the messages. An example of `ChatCompletionMessage` looks like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ChatCompletionMessage(\n",
    "    content=None,\n",
    "    refusal=None,\n",
    "    role='assistant',\n",
    "    annotations=[],\n",
    "    audio=None,\n",
    "    function_call=None,\n",
    "    tool_calls=[\n",
    "        ChatCompletionMessageFunctionToolCall(\n",
    "            id='call_ymMki5TBB91efJhMPjgoqjop',\n",
    "            function=Function(\n",
    "                arguments='{\"query\":\"radio observations of recurrent novae\",\"max_results\":5}',\n",
    "                name='arxiv_search_tool'\n",
    "            ),\n",
    "            type='function'\n",
    "        )\n",
    "    ]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Assuming that `msg` if of type `ChatCompletionMessage`, if you wanted to get the `name` of a `tool_call` you can do something like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    " for call in msg.tool_calls:\n",
    "    tool_name = call.function.name\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, the `result` variable will be created by actually calling the function associated with each tool (`tool_func`).\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging these hints, you'll work towards an implementation that enables robust data gathering and report generation through smart tool integration."

    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Use the specified model (e.g., `\"gpt-4o-mini\"`) and set the temperature equal to the `temperature` parameter of the graded function.\n",

    "## Exercise 3: Convert Report to HTML\n",
    "**Goal:** Implement `convert_report_to_html(report)`.\n",
    "This exercise focuses on transforming a plain text research report into a well-structured HTML document. You will build a function to facilitate this conversion using a language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Create a User Prompt\n",
    "- **Objective**: Instruct the model to transform plain text into HTML structure.\n",
    "- **Format**: Ensure the output is valid, clean HTML with appropriate section headers, formatted paragraphs, and clickable links.\n",
    "- **Details**: Preserve the citation style and request that the model responds only with HTML, without additional commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Configure the Response Call\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Use the specified model (e.g., `\"gpt-4o\"`) and set an appropriate temperature to balance creativity and accuracy.\n",
    "- **Structure**: Configure the `CLIENT.chat.completions.create` call properly, using both system and user prompts to ensure a clear and focused task description.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you'll effectively convert plaintext reports into formatted HTML documents."
