    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools‚Äîsuch as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you‚Äôll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML‚Äîlaying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."
